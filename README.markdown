# Personal Information and Schedule Management Webpage

This repository contains a static HTML webpage designed to serve as a comprehensive personal portfolio and schedule management tool. Built using HTML, it integrates personal details, social media links, an academic toolkit, and an interactive schedule system. The project is styled with CSS (assumed to be linked externally or embedded) and enhanced with JavaScript (assumed for interactivity), offering a user-friendly interface for both personal reference and public sharing.

## Modifying the Webpage

### Adding, Deleting, or Editing Major Features

To customize the webpage’s core structure:

- **Adding a New Section**:
  1. In `index.html`, locate the `<nav>` element:
     ```html
     <nav> <ul> <li><a href="#about">About</a></li> ... </ul> </nav>
     ```
  2. Add a new `<li><a href="#new-section">New Section</a></li>` to the list.
  3. Below the existing `<section>` tags, insert:
     ```html
     <section id="new-section">
       <div class="section-content">
         <h2>GMT+8 00:00</h2>
         <h1>New Section</h1>
         <!-- Add content here -->
       </div>
     </section>
     ```
  4. Style the new section in your CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`) to match existing sections.

- **Deleting a Section**:
  1. Remove the corresponding `<li>` from the `<nav>` element.
  2. Delete the entire `<section>` tag with the matching `id` (e.g., `<section id="social">...</section>`).

- **Editing a Section**:
  1. Locate the `<section>` by its `id` (e.g., `id="toolkit"`).
  2. Modify the `<h1>` title or inner content as needed. For example, to rename "Toolkit" to "Resources":
     ```html
     <h1>Resources</h1>
     ```
